## Instructions 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Review this website for more details on using R Markdown <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your R code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

Submit **both**  the rmd and generated output files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction.

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(1,2,3,\ldots,10)$.

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Question 1

a) Create and print a vector `x` with all integers 1-100, and a vector `y` with every fifth integer in the same range. What is the difference in lengths of the vectors `x` and `y`?. (8 points)
Hint: use `seq()`function, every fifth element of "y" will be like [1,6,11,.....].

```{r}
x <- seq(1,100)
y <- seq(1,100,5)
print("The vector x is:")
(x)
print("The vector y is:")
(y)
print("The difference between the legths of x and y is")
(length(x)-length(y))
```

b) Create a new vector, "x_square", with the square of elements at indices 3, 6, 7, 10, 15, 22, 23, 24, and 30 from the variable "x". 
Hint: Use indexing rather than a for loop. Calculate the mean and median of the last five values from x_square.

```{r}
(x_square <- c(x[3]^2, x[6]^2, x[7]^2, x[10]^2, x[15]^2, x[22]^2, x[23]^2, x[24]^2, x[30]^2))
(mean(x_square[-4:-1]))
(median(x_square[5:9]))

```

c) Would it be correct to use the following commands to convert a factor variable to a numeric variable? Explain your answer.

`factorVar <- factor(c(1, 6, 5.4, 3.2));as.numeric(factorVar)`

```{r}
#It would not be correct as as.numeric() 
#will convert the individual factor levels of 
#the factor variable to numeric values if they werent
#already numeric, hoever they will still 
#remain as factor levels.
```

d) Assume that you would read a comma-separated file `dataset.csv` consists of missing values represented by question marks (`?`) and exclamation mark (`!`). How can you read this type of files in R (please include your code in the answer section)?

```{r}
#When importing the csv i would use the read.csv()
#function and set na.strings option to switch any strings
#that match ? or ! to the logical value NA 
#(i.e. c("?", "!"))
```

## Question 2

a) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{100}\frac{2^{n}}{(n-1)!}$$

```{r}
dummy_vec <- seq(1:100)
for(i in 1:100) {
  num <- 2^i
  den <- factorial(i-1)
  dummy_vec[i] <- num/den
}
(sum(dummy_vec))
```

b) Compute: $$\sum_{n=1}^{10}\left(\frac{2^{n}}{n^2} + \frac{n^{4}}{4^{n}}\right)$$

```{r}
dv1 <- seq(1,10)
dv2 <- seq(1,10)
for (i in 1:10){
  n1 <- 2^i
  d1 <- i^2
  n2 <- i^4
  d2 <- 4^i
  dv1[i] <- n1/d1
  dv2[i] <- n2/d2
  
}
(sum(dv1+dv2))

```

c) Compute: $$\sum_{n=0}^{10} \frac{1}{(n+1)!}$$ (Hint: Use `factorial(n)` to compute $n!$)

```{r}
d_vec <- seq(0:10)
for(i in 0:10){
  d_vec[i] <- 1/factorial(i+1)
}
(sum(d_vec))
```

d) Compute: $$\prod_{n=3}^{33} \left(3n + \frac{3}{\sqrt[3]{n}}\right)$$

```{r}
dummy_v <- seq(3,33)
for(i in 3:33){
  a <- 3*i
  b <- 3/(i^(1/3))
  dummy_v[i-2] <- a+b
}
(dummy_v)
for(i in 4:33){
  dummy_v[i-2] <- dummy_v[i-3]*dummy_v[i-2]
}
(dummy_v)
(dummy_v[31])
```

e) Explain the output of this R-command:
`c(0:5)[NA]`

```{r}
#the output of this r command is NA NA NA NA NA NA
#this is because the square brackets are used to find
#subsets corresponding to thindex inside the brackets
#if the index of the subset we want to select is NA 
#(not available) then for each element in the vector
#c(0:5) its representative in the subset [NA] 
#will also be unavailable.
```

f) What is the difference between is.vector() and is.numeric() functions?

```{r}
#is.vector() checkes to see whether an object in 
#r is a vector. is.numeric() takes in a vector as input
#and checks to see if that vector is of numeric class.
```

g) There are lost of packages in R. `RShiny` is one of it (https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Please investigate this package and list at least three advantages and three disadvantages of using `RShiny` package?
```{r}
#helps us build web applications without having to know 
#any html, css or javascript knowledge
#its free
#its compatible with R, and highly cusomisable/extensible
```

## Question 3
`iris` dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Install the `iris` dataset on your computer using the command `install.packages("datasets")`. Then, load the `datasets` package into your session using the following command.
```{r}
library(datasets)
```

a) Display the first ten rows of the `iris` data set.

```{r}
head(iris, 10)
```

b) Compute the average of the first four variables (Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length and Petal.Width) using `sapply()` function.

Hint: You might need to consider removing the `NA` values, otherwise the average will not be computed.

```{r}
sapply(iris[c('Sepal.Length', 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', 'Petal.Width')], mean)

m_count <- sum(is.na(iris))
if(("NA"%in% iris)|
   ("na"%in% iris) | (""%in% iris)|(NA %in% iris) ){
  print("True")
  m_count<- m_count +1
}
str_c("There are ", m_count, " missing values")

```

c) Show how to use R to replace the missing values in this dataset with plausible ones.

```{r}
#first when we read in the csv file we replace any
#variants of NA with the logical value NA 
#(As shown above).
#when using variables or instances in the data set in
#functions or as part of calculations we can use
#na.omit() to omit the missing values from our calculations.
#depending on how frequently NA values appear in certain
#variables, and how useful those variables are to our
#analysis we can remove those variables entirely  
# likewise, if certain variables our vital to our
#analysis, we can even consider removing entires
#instances where these variables have a NA value, or if
#these instances have a high occurence of NA values.
```

d) Compute the standard deviation for only the first and the third variables (Sepal.Length and Petal.Length)

```{r}
sapply(iris[c('Sepal.Length', 'Petal.Length')], sd)
```

e) Construct a boxplot for `Sepal.Width` variable, then display the values of all the outliers. Explain how these outliers have been calculated.

```{r}
summary(iris["Sepal.Width"])
str(iris)
sw_box <- boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width)
sw_box$out # this gives us the outliers of sepal.width; 4.4 4.1 4.2 2.0
#how have these been calculated? explain
```

f) Compute the upper quartile of the `Sepal.Width` variable with two different methods.

```{r}
sw_box$stats[4,] #give us the upper quartile

```

g) Construct a pie chart to describe the species with 'Sepal.Length' less than 7 centimeters.
```{r}
species_counts <- c(0,0,0)
for (row in 1:nrow(iris)){
  if ((iris[row, "Species"] == "setosa") & (iris[row, "Sepal.Length"]< 7)){
    species_counts[1] <- species_counts[1] +1
  }
  if((iris[row, "Species"] == "versicolor") & (iris[row, "Sepal.Length"]< 7)){
    species_counts[2] <- species_counts[2] +1
  }
  if((iris[row, "Species"] == "virginica") & (iris[row, "Sepal.Length"]< 7)){
    species_counts[3] <- species_counts[3] +1
  }}
species_counts
pie(species_counts, labels = c("setosa","versicolor", "virginica" ))


```
